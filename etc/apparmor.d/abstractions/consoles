# there are three common ways to refer to consoles
/dev/console rw,
/dev/tty     rw,
# this next entry is a tad unfortunate; /dev/tty will always be
# associated with the controlling terminal by the kernel, but if a
# program uses the /dev/pts/ interface, it actually has access to
# -all- xterm, sshd, etc, terminals on the system.
/dev/pts/[0-9]*   rw,
/dev/pts/         r,
